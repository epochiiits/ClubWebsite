              Epoch was founded in 2020 by a group of computer
              science students who wanted to create a more
              collaborative and practical learning environment.
              What started as informal study sessions quickly
              grew into a thriving community of over 500 members.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, we've organized more than 100
              workshops, hosted 50+ guest speakers from top tech
              companies, and facilitated countless project
              collaborations. Our members have gone on to work at
              leading tech companies, start their own ventures,
              and contribute to open-source projects worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Epoch continues to evolve, embracing new
              technologies and adapting to the changing needs of
              our community. We're proud of our journey and
